## Abstract
*Gryllus assimilis*, commonly known as Jamaican field cricket, is an edible insect with significant economic value in sustainable food production. Despite its importance, a high-quality reference genome of *G. assimilis* has been lacking. Here, we report a chromosome-level reference genome of *G. assimilis* based on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing, Illumina sequencing, and Hi-C technologies. The assembled genome has a total length of 1.60 Gbp with scaffold N50 of 102 Mbp, and 96.80% of the genome was assigned to 15 chromosome-scale scaffolds. The assembly completeness was validated using BUSCO, achieving 99.5% completeness against the Arthropoda database. We predicted 27,645 protein-coding genes, and 825 Mb repetitive elements were annotated in the reference genome. This reference genome of *G. assimilis* will provide a basis for the subsequent development of genomic resources, offering insights for future functional genomic studies, comparative genomics, and DNA-informed breeding of this species. 

## Data Records
The assembled genome has been deposited at GenBank under the accession number [GCA_046254815.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_046254815.1/)).
  
The assembled genome and annotation datasets are also available in [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_b_Chromosome-scale_whole_genome_sequences_and_annotation_of_the_Jamaican_field_cricket_b_b_i_Gryllus_assimilis_i_b_/26761927).
