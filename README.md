# Gryllus-assimilis
**Chromosome-scale whole genome sequences and annotation of the Jamaican field cricket Gryllus assimilis**

Gryllus assimilis, commonly known as Jamaican field cricket, is an edible insect with significant economic value in sustainable food production. Despite its importance, a high-quality reference genome of G. assimilis has been lacking. Here, we report a chromosome-level reference genome of G. assimilis based on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing and Hi-C technologies. The assembled genome has a total length of 1.60 Gbp with scaffold N50 of 102 Mbp, and 96.80% of the genome was assigned to 15 chromosome-scale scaffolds. The assembly completeness was validated using BUSCO, achieving 99.5% completeness against the Arthropoda database. We predicted 28,120 protein-coding genes, and 825 Mb repetitive elements were annotated in the reference genome. This reference genome of G. assimilis will provide a basis for the subsequent development of genomic resources, offering insights for future functional genomic studies, comparative genomics, and DNA-informed breeding of this species.
